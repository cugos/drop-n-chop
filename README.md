Dropchop is a browser-based GIS powered by [Mapbox.js](http://mapbox.com/mapbox.js) and [Turf.js](http://turfjs.org). The need for small-scale GIS operations comes up quite frequently in our work, especially for those without much time. Dropchop aims to empower your spatial data by removing complexity. This project is currently a proof-of-concept and explores [three hypotheses](https://github.com/cugos/dropchop/wiki/Dropchop-Inspiration):

1. **GIS can be data-first, not operation-first.**
2. **GIS doesn't always require a server.**
3. **GIS is open.**
